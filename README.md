Currently Learning Ruby on Rails and Git...Stay Tuned

To get started..Documentation:
http://rubyonrails.org/documentation
http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/
http://git-scm.com/book

I don't plan on venturing from these three sources of docs. I'm using git for this so I can start to use git in a test-friendly project, focusing on documentation. 

Any rails apps and example pieces of code I might write to test my knowledge will also be up here. Feel free to follow along, make comments, change incorrect things, or show me better ways of writing code.
