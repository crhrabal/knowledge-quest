**Getting Started**

I don't know what the preferred way of setting up a ruby on rails environment. I'm following the Rails documentation,
as well as using Ubuntu 14.04. There might be multiple ways to skin a cat, but this is how I'm going to do things while I
learn. Feel free to correct me if you find anything could be improved.

Type this in a terminal:

* sudo apt-get install ruby-rails-4.0 libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 nodejs apache2 git
* mkdir rubyrailsprojects
* cd rubyrailprojects
* rails new knowledge-quest
* bundle install
* cd knowledge-quest
* bundle
* rails server
